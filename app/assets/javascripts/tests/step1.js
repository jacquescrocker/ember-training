/*
  In Step 1, you are going to load some models from fixture data in the
  router.

  Then, you'll use the {{#each}} helper that you learned about to print
  each of the albums using a template.

  First, make sure you've defined an App.Store in your app.js file:

      App.Store = DS.Store.extend({
        revision: 11,
        adapter: 'DS.FixtureAdapter'
      });

  Next, create a route handler for the index template, and make sure
  you set its model to the list of albums.

  Finally, delete all but one of the static albums in the index template.
  Use the {{#each}} helper to re-use the remaining HTML once per album
  in the application. Use Handlebars properties like {{name}} to use the
  values on the model instead of hard-coding.

  Note: to get started, remove the {{#linkTo}} helper around the album
  artwork. We'll add it back in a later step.
